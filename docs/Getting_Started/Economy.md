## How to earn money

### Shop

The shop allows you to buy and sell basic materials and nether exclusive items. You can access this with the `/shop` command.

### Auction House

The Auction House is the place to trade your items for money with other players. You can access this with the `/ah` command.

### Vouchers

Just like redeeming vouchers, you can also write them to give to other players or to store money in an item form. Using paper and the /voucher command you can set a value you'd like to store on the voucher. Many of these vouches can be found at the new raidbases.
