## How to earn money

### Shop

The shop allows you to buy and sell basic materials and nether exclusive items. You can access this with the `/shop` command.

### Auction House

The Auction House is the place to trade your items for money with other players. Accessed with the `/ah` command, items can be sold for a configurable amount. Listings are also shown in our Discord server.   

### Vouchers

Just like redeeming vouchers, you can also write them to give to other players or store money in an item form. Using paper and the `/voucher` command you can set a value you'd like to store on the voucher. Many of these vouchers can be found at the new raidbases. Keep in mind that vouchers do not get counted into BalTop.
