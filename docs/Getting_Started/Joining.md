# Joining

## General Information

We provide the modpack to our players to ease the joining process. You can download it on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/geopol) (More information below)


- **Normal** (Includes every required mod and the custom scripts)

Modification of the client for an advantage is cheating and bannable. This includes certain Texture Packs. (I.e: Xray, Invisibly Be Gone, Fullbright, etc)   

The modpack gets updated regularly. When this happens, an update will be required before rejoining. More on this below.

### Ram

We recommend at least 6GB of RAM due to the amount of mods and assets. If you have more than 6GB available, feel free to allocate more RAM (8GB is more than enough) This will help with performance and will reduce lag.

To change the amount of RAM given to each Minecraft instance in the Curseforge launcher, head over to the settings button located in the lower right corner. Then click on Minecraft, scroll down, and change the amount with the slider.

## Installing using Modrinth

To install from Modrinth, download an open [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) or [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) and search for GeoPol in the modpacks. From here it will install the latest version. Note that you will also need to install **Optifine** separately if you want to use shaders. [More on this.](/docs/category/the-server).

## Installing using Curseforge

To install, open your favorite launcher and search for GeoPol. From here it will install the latest version. Note that you will also need to install **Optifine** separately if you want to use shaders. [More on this](/docs/category/the-server) In the event of a modpack update, press the two arrows next to the "Play" button and download the newest version. [More info on updating](https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000206622-how-to-update-change-a-modpack-s-version)

Alternatively, you can install the modpack from the [**Curseforge Website**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/geopol), but you will need to manually import the zip file into your launcher.
