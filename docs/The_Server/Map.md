# World Gen

The map is a BoP world with a 4000 x 4000 barrier, meaning 2k from each side out from spawn. You can find any sort of terrain, from the low sweeping plains to the high mountains, generating all the needed ores and structures.

### World Border

The world border is currently set to **4000 blocks** from the spawn, so 2k in each direction. This is to stop players from exploring too far away from the spawn and to prevent lag. The world border may be expanded in the future, but not too much, as we want to keep the map compact to have more centralized battles and factions.

### Dimensions

***The Nether is disabled*** You can find all of the materials in the shop.

***The End is enabled*** ~~You can even find some custom loot in the End Cities.~~ (Coming soon)
## Dynamic Map

The Dynamic Map (Dynmap) is a plugin that allows you to see the map of our server in real time, and  it's very useful for finding your way around the server. You can view the map on our website [here](http://51.91.25.191:5311/). 

Our map displays the following:
- Player list
- Top-down view and Isometric view
- The Overworld
- World border
- Spawn's location 
- *Sadly no modded blocks*
