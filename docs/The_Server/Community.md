## Our team

The GeoPol team is dedicated to making GeoPol a fun and enjoyable server, where everyone has the chance to make long-lasting memories together with friends. If you are interested in joining, please keep a look out for application forms on our Discord.

## Support us

Currently, GeoPol is a non-profit server. We do not have any plans to monetize the server. However, we do have a [ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/geopolmc), where you can make one-time donations or even subscribe to a monthly payment. We will use the money to pay for the server and premium features that help us keep a stable and enjoyable environment.
