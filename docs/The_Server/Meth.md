# Meth

Meth is a good but risky way to make some quick cash. To obtain ingredients and sell the final product, players must travel to the bandit camp at 525, 600. After obtaining the ingredients, players must set up all the machines that they will need in a place safe from prying eyes. After everything is set up, players have to carefully follow the recipe or else they could risk exploding their equipment and themselves.

## Ingrediants

The two ingredients needed for meth are methylamine and a special kind of aluminum oxide, both of which can only be obtained from the bandit camp. Players should be warned that consuming any ingredients will result in severe poisoning.

## Set-up

To set up a meth lab, players must first buy or craft a cook hammer.

After obtaining a cook hammer, players can start setting up the 4 machines required to cook classic blue meth. For the first machine, players need to craft and place down a hopper. After the hopper is placed, right-click it with the cook hammer in hand to turn it into a filter.

The second machine needed is called a mixer and is made using a cauldron. Like the previous filter, players simply need to right-click it with a cook hammer to turn it into a machine.

The third and most expensive machine is the freezer, made using seven iron blocks for insulation. Unlike the others, the freezer has two blocks and only the bottom block is the freezer, so make sure you click the right block with the cook hammer.

The final machine is called a crusher and is used to break up your final product. The crusher is made using a jukebox right-clicked with a cook hammer.

## Cooking

After you have your machines set up, the first step in cooking is to filter your methylamine of any impurities. You do this by right-clicking the filter with the methylamine in your hand and waiting 30 seconds while it works. After it is done, you can take the filtered methylamine out by right-clicking the filter again.

Once you have your filtered methylamine, you can pour it into your mixer and then add your aluminum. After you put both in, you have to right-click the mixer 10 times to stir it. When the aluminum is fully mixed in, you will get 5 bowls of meth sludge.

Next, you can open your freezer, put in all 5 meth sludge bowls, and click the green start button. After 1 minute, you can open the freezer and take out the 5 frozen meth crystals.

Lastly, you insert your meth crystals one by one into the crusher to break them up into meth shards. Each meth crystal will break up into 3 meth shards that can either be consumed or sold in a crate.

## Selling

To sell your meth to a dealer at the bandit camp, it must first be put into a crate. The crafting recipe for a meth crate is one chest surrounded by 8 meth shards. After crafting a meth crate, take it to the bandit camp at 525, 600. Go down the alley behind the ingredient shop, and to the right of the dumpster you will find Bouncy Johnson who will pay you $200 for your crate of meth. Be aware of what time you go there, as Bouncy Johnson only sells during the night.
