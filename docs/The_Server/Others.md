# Alcohol

This page contains information about the alcohol plugin, Brewery, that the server uses.

This plugin allows for you to create alcoholic drinks based on custom recipes. This page will list how to make a brewing set up and how to make all of the different brews.

### Drinks:

- Wheatbeer
- Beer
- Darkbeer
- Mead
- Ethanol
- Apple Mead
- Rum
- Vodka
- Red Wine
- White Wine
- Absinthe

### Brewing Setup:

You will need 3 things to brew drinks: a cauldron to ferment, a brewing stand to distill, and a barrel to age.

The cauldron needs to be placed over a fire and filled with water like so:<br/>![2023-04-01_12 07 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105452264/229305066-85fa29d4-e3e5-4dba-a878-1050922de5ec.png)

The brewing stand doesn't need fuel, but it does need a single piece of glowstone in the top:![2023-04-01_12 15 59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105452264/229305258-19f261a0-8208-40ba-889c-380423a78ebf.png)

The barrel is made out of 8 wooden stairs, the wood that you need can change based on the drink you are making. You then place a sign on the bottom right of the front side with the word "Barrel" written on it:![2023-04-01_12 28 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105452264/229305806-58b94653-14be-497b-88db-e98a7bfd18a2.png)

### Fermenting:

Fermenting is the first step in creating a drink. You can ferment things using the cauldron that you put over a fire. First, make sure that there is water in the cauldron and that there is a fire directly under it. Second, put all of your ingredients in the pot by right clicking it with the ingredients in your hand. Different drinks will have different ingredients, but for this example we will be using rum. Rum takes 14 sugarcane, which you would hold in your hand and right click the pot with. After your ingredients are in the pot, you have to wait however long the recipe calls for. For our example, rum takes 5 minutes to cook. To check how long a cauldron has been boiling, you can right click it with a clock. Finally, once your cauldron has been brewing for the optimal amount of time, you can take out your fermented product using bottles.

### Distilling

The second and easiest step in the brewing process in distilling your fermented product. To do this, you first have to check how many times (if at all) you need to distill your drink. To continue our example, you would need to distill rum 2 times. Second, you need to place your drinks inside the brewing stand that you set up and wait for the arrow to fill up. Once you have distilled your drink once, you can see how many times it has been distilled by hovering over it with your mouse. After you distill your drink the right amount of times, you can take your bottles out of the brewing stand and move on to the final step.

### Aging

The third and final step to brewing is to age your drink in the custom barrel you made. Most drinks need to be aged, but some such as vodka do not. How long a drink has and needs to be aged is counted in minecraft days. One minecraft day is equivalent to 20 minutes in real life. To complete our example from before, rum needs to be aged for 14 minecraft days or 4 hours and 40 minutes in real life. To age your drink, you would open your barrel by right clicking the sign and putting your bottles inside. After the drink has been aged for 1 minecraft day, it will show how long it has been aged for in the description of the item in the form of years (1 year equals 1 minecraft day). After you have aged your drink, you can take it out of the barrel and drink up!

### Quality

The quality of a drink is dependant on how closely you followed the recipe and what the difficulty rating of the drink is. The quality is represented by the amount of stars in your drink's description. Some drinks (like wine) are harder to make than others and you have to get the recipe perfect for it to be 5 stars. Other drinks (like beer) are easier and give you a bit of leniency if you mess up. The quality will also affect the name of the item. For example, with rum, a top quality bottle will be called Golden Rum, a mid quality bottle will be called Spicy Rum, and a low quality bottle will be called Bitter Rum.

### Drunkness

Your drunkness level is shown every time you consume alcohol above your hotbar. Some drinks will be stonger than others and you can see the alcohol level in the items description. Being drunk can have many effects, such as slurring your chat messages, making you stumble around randomly, making you puke out soul sand, and even making you faint (get kicked) if you drink too much. Drunkness goes away slowly over time, but can also be gotten rid of by eating bread and drinking milk.
