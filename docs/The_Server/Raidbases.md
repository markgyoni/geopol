# Raidbases

Raidbases are structures run by npcs from the custom npcs mod. There are 5 tiers of raidbase with 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest. These bases can be a great source of supplies, weapons, and money, but they do come with some risks. If players can fight their way into a raidbase, they can find one of the loot chests in the deepest part of the base. After opening a chest, the players will be given a timer to loot all they can and get out. After the timer runs out, the raidbase will be filled in with barriers and all players still inside will be teleported out. After a cooldown that varies for each base, the base will be re-opened and announced in chat.

## Tier 1

The tier 1 raidbase is the easiest but least rewarding raidbase. Located at -750, -70, this raidbase is run by common bandits who won't put up much of a fight if dealt with strategically. Although an invisible wall prevents flanking from the back or sides, players can choose to charge in head-on or try to lure enemies out one by one. There is one loot chest in the base that has useful supplies and the occasional pistol for a starting player. After opening the chest, players will have 30 seconds to grab what they need before the base goes on its 30-minute-long cooldown.

## Tier 2

The tier 2 raidbase is located at -500, -450, and is controlled by a more organized group of outlaws. Players will have to face more varied enemies including shotgunners, attack dogs, riflemen, and a sniper. There is only one entrance that faces the ocean, so players may wish to take a boat to the docks and attack from there. However, caution is advised with this approach because the docks are guarded by a shotgunner and a dog. These outlaws profit off of the food and alcohol trade using their dock, so players can expect to find more metals and provisions than in the tier 1 base, but guns are still limited to pistols. This base has a loot timer of 1 minute and a cooldown of 1 hour.

## Tier 3

The tier 3 raidbase is located at 450, 300, and is a well-guarded military checkpoint. Players will have trouble trying to take on this base alone, so it is advised to bring a small team. The checkpoint is overlooked by a large watch tower with 2 snipers inside that will shoot anything that gets close to the entrance. Inside, there is a barracks and a door leading down into a bunker. This base gets regular shipments of military gear from the tier 5 raidbase, but it doesn't have much in the way of food or materials. Players will have 2 minutes to loot after triggering the timer and will have to wait a 2-hour cooldown.

## Tier 4

The tier 4 raidbase is a heavily guarded military bunker dug into a mountain at -2000, 0. Enemies here are well-trained and armed to be able to deal huge damage to even an armored opponent. It is recommended that players form a group to take on this raidbase and strategize well before raiding. There is one entrance facing toward the ocean, and coming from any other direction is made difficult by the mountainous terrain. The bunker acts as storage for the military and is stocked with rifles, SMGs, pistols, backpacks, armor, vests, food, an occasional vehicle frame, and payroll. The loot is well worth the risk and can be a massive help to supplying an army. The timer to loot is 5 minutes long and the cooldown is 4 hours.

## Tier 5

The tier 5 raidbase is the military HQ at 750, 800, which supplies the tier 3 and 4 raidbase as well as sends out airdrops. Ran by the decorated Lt. General Chorgle, this base leaves no room for attackers to get through unnoticed. With armed guards and turrets at every corner, trying to take this base without good teammates, gear, or planning would lead to certain death. On the other hand, this base has a stockpile of money, vehicle frames, gear, weapons, and materials waiting for any team skilled enough to make it to the end. Players will be given 10 minutes after opening a chest and the base has a cooldown of 5 hours.
