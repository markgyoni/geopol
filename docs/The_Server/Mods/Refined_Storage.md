Refined Storage is a storage mod where you can build a storage network made up of devices. Those devices manipulate your storage. This page is based on the [Official Wiki](https://refinedmods.com/refined-storage/wiki/), and we recommend  checking in out if you want more information.

The **Controller** is the “core” of your storage network. You’ll be connecting all the Refined Storage devices to this block.

The Controller needs energy. More specifically, **Forge Energy or Redstone Flux**.

Disks are used to store items or fluids. You can store them in a **Disk Drive**.

## Accessing your storage

The Grid is the main way to access your storage. It can be used to insert and extract items from your storage manually.
There are multiple types of Grids:
- Normal Grid
- Crafting Grid
- Pattern Grid
- Fluid Grid
- Processing Grid
- Wireless Grid
## Automatic Movemment

### Exporter
To get items out of your storage network, use an Exporter and connect it to an inventory (I.e A Chest) where you want to export to.

Configure the filter slots of the Exporter to the items you want to export.

### Importer
To get items into your storage network, use an Importer and connect it to an inventory where you want to import from.

### Interface
Want the best of both worlds? Use an Interface to get importing and exporting functionality in one block.

### Constructor
To place blocks from your storage network in the world, use an Constructor.

Configure the filter slots of the Constructor to the block/s you want to place.

### Destructor
To destroy and insert blocks from the world into your storage, use an Destructor.

You can configure a whitelist or blacklist of blocks to destroy.
