## GeoPol Modlist

### Here you can find the full list of mods used for our server, together with their versions.

You can only join the server with the [Official GeoPol Modpack](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/geopol) from Curseforge.

We have a few allowed mods on top of this, these are:
- [Optifine.](https://www.optifine.net/) Makes the game run buttery smooth, and adds shader support. Most of Optfine's optimization is done better by the mods already in the pack, we do not recommend adding Optfine.  
- [IngameAccountSwitcher.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/in-game-account-switcher) Switch to a different Minecraft account without relaunching the game.
- [ReplayMod.](https://www.replaymod.com/) Record footage from different angles, great for YouTuber's!

### Suggesting mods

You can suggest mods to us in our Discord Server. Supporter's of our server can send priority suggestions!
