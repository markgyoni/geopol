# Immersive Vehicles
Immersive Vehicles, formerly known as Minecraft Transport Simulator, is a pack-based vehicle mod that adds vehicles to Minecraft. 

### Packs?
Yes, packs. Whilst Immersive Vehicles does have a default pack, which is also installed on our server, independent creators can make their own packs. GeoPol features the following packs:

 - Immersive Vehicles (MTS/IV) - Official Content Pack
 - UNU Civilian Vehicles
 - UNU Military Vehicles
 - UNU Parts Pack
 - IAV Parts pack
 - VEB Automobilwerke Schwikau
 - Hero Aviation Helicopter Pack



### How do I get a vehicle?
You need to craft parts, such as engines, and then assemble the vehicle itself. This may take a longer period of time, depending on what kind of vehicle you are looking for. If you are only looking for something to traverse the map with, you can build an oak plane included in the Official Content Pack, which will do the job.

### Civilian Vehicles
Crafting everyday cars and simple planes is, well, simple. Parts can be crafted in workbenches. These vehicles are the cheapest to make, although do not have armor or mounted guns.  

### Military Vehicles
Military vehicles, such as tanks, are a different story. They are expensive, and their munitions are expensive, but the payoff may be worth the investment for combined arms warfare. V5 currently has tanks, BTRs, IFVs, attack helicopters and jets, with most of them from the VEB Automobilwerke Schwikau pack.

You can also craft stationary artillery rigs and or tow said artillery.
