# Immersive Technology

This mod is a complex addition to the Immersive Engineering mod group. It adds several multiblocks such as: 

**- The Alternator** - When this is connected to a Steam Turbine, produces power using the kinetic energy.

**- The Distiller** - The machine which produces Distilled Water from normal Water.

**- The Boiler** - A machine which produces Steam from Distilled Water and normal Water (Distilled is slightly more efficient). The Boiler needs Biodiesel or other suitable combustible fuels as a fuel to work, each of them use different amounts of fluid to heat the steam. Like itâ€™s more green counterpart the Boiler needs to heat up to full to meet its peak efficiency.

**- The Solar Reflector** - The multiblock which reflects sunlight in the direction of the Solar Tower.

**- The Solar Tower** - A machine which produces Steam from Distilled Water and normal Water (Distilled is more efficient). Note: The Solar Tower needs at least 1 Solar Reflector to work. Needs multiple reflectors to reach better levels of steam output.

**- The Steam Turbine** - A massive multiblock to help produce power from steam when attached to an Alternator. 

**- The Gas Turbine** - A slightly less massive machine to help produce power from combustible fuels when attached to an Alternator. 

**- The Steel Tank** - A tank that holds more than the IE iron multiblock tank, can also output fluids faster.

**- The Cooling Tower** - This converts exhaust steam back to Distilled Water or Water, depending on the inputs supplied.
And plenty more!

:::info Note

Along with these multi blocks it adds some small useful additions, like trash cans for various types of fluids or items. Any information not found here on Immersive Technology or Energy can be found in the engineers manual, like the rest of the Immersive series. (excluding Immersive Vehicles.)
